Hi there! I'm Ben. I love to develop iOS apps. 

I have developed for the last four years with assembly, C, C++, Java, the browser stack (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), PHP, Ruby, Node, and Objective-C. Through these varied platforms, iOS development stuck out as my clear favorite. My enjoyment for it allows me to do the best work I am capable of.

When I'm not working to make your app beautiful, I spread my time among varied interests. I have played tennis since I was 13 and love to compete. I played my first season of <a href="http://tennislink.usta.com/Leagues/Main/StatsAndStandings.aspx?t=R-17&search=Benjamin%20Martin&OrgURL=http://tennislink.usta.com/Leagues/Common/Default.aspx" class="footer-link">USTA</a> in 2012 and went 12-1 at the 4.0 level. I then got bumped up to 4.5 and went 1-5. Mmm, humble pie.
